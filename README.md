# UCL_Project_MATLAB
This Code here cotains the important matlab codes in the project. There are two part. The first part is the image processing part. Another part is the trajectory alignment part.

For the image processing part, there are two files. The reader.m file is used for reading the video, dividing the video into frames, sharpen the frames, incresing the contrast, and change the size of the frames. The video is not here because the size limit of github. The path and video\frame names in these files should be change to let the code run.

For the trajectory alignment part, the main file is the TrajectoryAlignMain.m file. There are two example trajectories in the Trajectory folder. There are an external library function icp() in the external_library folder, the reference is shown in the bottom. To let the code run sucessfully, some path in the code may need be changed.
